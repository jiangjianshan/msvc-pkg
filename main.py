    Primary application entry point orchestrating the complete package management workflow.

    Executes the full application lifecycle with comprehensive error handling and
    resource management. Coordinates all major system components including logging
    initialization, dependency verification, command line parsing, and action execution.
    Ensures proper cleanup and exit code reporting regardless of execution outcome.

    Workflow:
    1. Initialize structured logging system for execution tracking
    2. Configure YAML output formatting for consistent null representation
    3. Validate and install required system dependencies via RuntimeManager
    4. Parse command line arguments to determine execution parameters
    5. Dispatch to appropriate action handler based on user request
    6. Handle exceptions and set appropriate exit codes
    7. Perform graceful shutdown with comprehensive resource cleanup

    Exits:
        sys.exit(0): Application completed successfully
        sys.exit(1): General error occurred during execution

    Raises:
        SystemExit: Always terminates with appropriate exit code

    Note:
        This function serves as the central coordination point for all application
        components and ensures proper error handling and resource cleanup regardless
        of execution path outcome.
